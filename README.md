Vulnerability Management:

Utilising Nessus Essentials and VMWare Workstation Player, this project was centred around performing vulnerability scans on a virtual machine (VM) running Windows 10.
There were four scans performed as part of this project:
  Scan 1:  After fresh installation of Windows.
  Scan 2:  Credentials of the Windows user was provided.
  Scan 3:  Legacy software was installed.
  Scan 4:  Some vulnerabilities remediated.

Scan 1
Scan was performed after installation of Windows 10 on VM.

Scan 2
Scan was performed with no modifications made to the Windows 10 VM.

Remediations were performed prior to scan.
In this case, Firefox was uninstalled from the VM and Windows Update was ran until no more updates were detected.
